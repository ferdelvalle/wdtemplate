## A simple template repository for web development

## By Fernando Del Valle

## Introduction

**This is just a simple template for web development made for my convenience** anyone else is welcome to use it.

## Branches

There are three branches

+ master
+ development (default)
+ feature_one (based on development)

## Why

The idea is to hit the ground running with a healthy git-flow already set up.
